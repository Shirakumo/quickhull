# About Quickhull
This is an implementation of the Quickhull algorithm by Barber, Dobkin, and Huhdanpaa[1] for constructing a convex hull of a 3D mesh, based on the implementation by Antti Kuukka[2].

## How To
Load the library and run ``org.shirakumo.fraf.quickhull:convex-hull`` with an array of packed vertices. It'll return a similarly packed array of vertices on the convex hull, along with an array of face indices that describe the surface of the hull. That's it.
